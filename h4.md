## x) Read and summarize

Cryptography is the art and science of keeping messages secure. It doesn’t only provide confidentiality, but also provides authentication, integrity and non-repudiation.
Cryptosystem is included with the algorithm, plaintext, ciphertext and keys.
Cryptography algorithms, which is also called cipher is a mathematical function used for encryption and decryption. If the security of the algorithm is a secret, then it is a restricted algorithm.
Modern cryptography algorithms use a key for encryption and decryption.

1.	Symmetric(conventional)- has only one key for both encrypt and decrypt
2.	Public key – has two different key, the public key can made public, message encryption done using this, only who has private key can decrypt the message.
   
Special cases like Digital signatures, encrypted by private key and decrypted by public key.

Common Algorithms are,
DES (Data Encryption Standard) – for Symmetric key
RSA (Rivest, Shamin, and Adleman) – For Public key
DSA (Digital signature Algorithms) – only for digital signature

Cryptoanalysis – Recovering plaintext of the message without access to the key.

Attack – An attempted cryptoanalysis.

Common attack types 
1.	Ciphertext -only attack
2.	Known-plaintext attack
3.	Chosen-plain text attack
4.	Adaptive – chosen plaintext attack
5.	Chosen ciphertext attack
6.	Chosen key attack
7.	Rubber-hose cryptoanalysis

Security of Algorithms depend on how hard they are to break, there are different categories of breaking.
Total break, Global deduction, Instance deduction, Information deduction

We can measure complexity of the attack by measuring data complexity, processing complexity, storage requirements.

There are two main encryption methods.
Steganography – Hide secret messages in other messages.
Transposition Ciphers- Plaintext remain same but order of the characters shuffled around.

## y) Find out frequency distribution of letters for a language that you know (other than English). What are the six most common letters?

Letter Frequencies of the language Spanish

Below are the most common letters.

E – 13.72%
A – 11-72%
O – 8.44%
S – 7.20%
N – 6.83%
R – 6.41%

## Z) Choose a password manager and Explain:

1. Threats it protects against:
   - 1Password helps protect against various threats, including password breaches, phishing attacks, and unauthorized access to the accounts. It securely stores and manages the passwords, making it difficult for attackers to break the online accounts.

2. What information is encrypted, what's not:
   - 1Password encrypts all the sensitive data, including passwords, usernames, and any other personal information store within it. The Master Password is the key to decrypt this information.  Master Password is not stored anywhere, ensuring that only you can access your data.

3. License and categorization:
   - 1Password offers both individual and family plans, which are subscription-based. They also offer a business plan for teams and enterprises. The license can be categorized as a subscription model, where users pay a regular fee for access to the service.

4. Data storage:
   - 1Password presently stores all database information using an Amazon Web Services Aurora database instance.

5. Data protection:
   - 1Password employs strong encryption and security measures to protect the data. They use the AES-256 encryption standard and implement end-to-end encryption.1Password also undergoes regular security audits to maintain the integrity of its service.

## a)  ETAOIN.  Crack this ciphertext:

HDMH'B TH. KWU'YI AWR WSSTOTMJJK M OWQINYIMLIY! MB KWU BII, BTGPJI BUNBHTHUHTWA OTPDIYB OMA NI NYWLIA RTHD SYIEUIAOK MAMJKBTB. BII KWU MH DHHP://HIYWLMYCTAIA.OWG

1st STEP

DHHP looks like HTTP so D=H, H=T, and OWG looks like COM

From this we can identify the letters below.
O=C, W=O, G=M

THMT’B TT KOU’YI AOR OSSTCTCTMJJK M COQINYIMLIY! MB KOU BII, BTMPJI 
BUNBTTTUTTOA CTPHIYB CMA NI NYOLIA RTTH SYIEUIACK MAMJKBTB. BII

## b) Demonstrate the use of a password manager

Password manager is like a super-secret digital key system that keeps our keys safe and makes our life easier and secure on the Web. 
The basic step is to create a Master Password, a strong one. This is not stored in the Password manager.
Then Whenever we create a new account online the password manager helps to generate a strong and unique key. These unique keys are stored by the password manager safely.
So, whenever we need to log to a specific account, we need to provide the Master key to open the password manager. 


## c) Encrypt and decrypt a message. Explain the purpose of each step. Explain why you choose the tool you're using.

Below is the plain text:

Our Secret got leaked be aware

Now we need to create the encrypted text, I am using Caesar Cipher

To make the encrypted message above, I shifted the alphabet by 5 and used below substitution table.

A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J   K   L   M   N   O   P   Q   R   S   T   U   V   W   X   Y   Z
F   G   H   I   J   K   L   M   N   O   P   Q   R   S   T   U   V   W   X   Y   Z   A   B   C   D   E

Encrypted message
JZW XJHWJO LTY QJFPJI GJ FBFWJ

This is a simple substitution method which replaces the each original letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting the alphabet letters.

If the recipient knows the shift amount, it is easy for the recipient to decrypt this.

JZW     XJHWJO    LTY       QJFPJI        GJ     FBFWJ
OUR    SECRET     GOT        LEAKED       BE     AWARE

I have chosen this method because it is easier to encrypt the message, also this can be decrypted by the recipient who does not have any computer knowledge. And this is a personal message between two people that has no valuable data, so the possibility of an attack is very low.
