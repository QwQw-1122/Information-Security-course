### Threat modeling manifesto

A threat model is a structured representation of potential security threats and vulnerabilities in a system or application.
Use the threat modeling manifesto as a guide to develop or refine the threat modeling methodology. It aims to enhance the effectiveness of threat modeling. It's not a step-by-step guide and is flexible in terms of methodologies.
Manifesto values - Prioritize finding and fixing design issues, Emphasize people and collaboration over processes. Focus on understanding rather than just compliance. Action is better. Continuously refine threat modeling approaches.
Manifesto Principles - Use threat modeling to improve security and privacy often. Align threat modeling with development practices and iterate with design changes. The outcomes of threat modeling should be valuable to stakeholders.  Effective dialogue is crucial for shared understanding, while documents record and enable measurement.
There are patterns that help to complete threat modeling like, systematic approach, informed creativity, varied viewpoints, useful toolkit, and theory into practice. There are anti-patterns which should not follow like, Hero threat modeler, Admiration for the problem, Tendency to Overfocus, Perfect representation.

###  Welcome to the Worlds Shortest Threat Modeling Course 

Threat modeling is a set of methods that allow us to think about security at that point so that the thing we build is as secure as we need it to be.
By answering below 4 questions we can complete the threat modelling successfully.
1.	What are we working on?
2.	What can go wrong?
3.	What are we going to do about it?
4.	Did we do a good enough job?
Below are few way of approaching to answer the first question.
By collaborating and discussing the answer together, By sketching the answers everyone has so that other people can engage easily, record or develop a document of the threat model which is working on, create data flow diagrams which are simple to draw and easy to understand.
We can answer for the second question with some guidance, we can refer STRIDE/Kill chain/business structure and pay attention to understand the critical situation. We need a Structure to get a degree of consistency in the answers we produce. STRIDE is one of the structures that can help to do so.
Risk modelling guide us to complete the third question. It helps us to quantify the probability or the impact of the threat which we discover and help us to decide about it.
To answer the 4th question we can share our threat model and see the feedback of others.

###  Chapter 1 - Dive In and Threat Model! 

Finding answers for these two questions will help easily identify threats.
Is that allowed? Who controls what?
By adding trust boundaries, we can identify which threats are more important ones. The threats which cross the boundaries known as important treats. 
STRIDE is the useful tool to identify what can go wrong with the security. The word in the name has different meanings.
Spoofing – Pretending to be something/ someone
Tampering – Modifying something that should not
Repudiation- Claiming you didn’t do it(regardless of whether you did or not)
Deniel of service – Attacks designed to prevent system from providing service
Information Disclosure – Exposing unauthorized info
Elevation of Privilege – technically able to do thing that is not authorized
There are 3 tips for identifying threats. Start with external entities, never ignore threats, focus on feasible threats.
Actions that can be taken for each threat are mitigate it, eliminate it, transfer it, accept it.
We can address the threat which we found from STRIDE in three steps. First we can identify the threat target, then we can mitigate the strategy and then create a mitigation technique for it.
While we addressing the threats there are other important things we need to carry on. Like Validate the techinique, Trust the operating system, lists the bugs.
Finally it is time to check the work. 
i.	Checking the model (is this complete?, is it accurate? Etc)
ii.	If needed update the diagram
iii.	Checking each threat (did I find all the threats, did I do right thing for these)
iv.	Checking your Tests(make sure there is a test to detect the threat)

### Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet

Below are the steps to follow before starting the threat model.
1.	Define Business Objectives: Before starting threat modeling, identify the business objectives of the applications and any security or compliance requirements related to regulations. 
2.	Identify Application Design: It helps in understanding the entire system's design, including trust boundaries.
3.	Review Existing Documentation: It may need updates or might be nonexistent, requiring you to create design documents.
4.	Create Design Documents: if there is no design document create it.
   
Below are the steps to take for Decompose and model the System
1.	Define and Evaluate Assets: Define and assess the assets involved in information flows based on their confidentiality, integrity, and availability. For this consider both Data in transit and Data at rest.
2.	Create an Information Flow Diagram: Develop an information flow diagram to illustrate the system's architecture and data flows. We can use Whiteboard architecture, and use tools like OWASP Threat Dragon, POIROT, MS TMT etc.
3.	Define Data Flow: Describe data flows within the Data Flow Diagram.
4.	Define Trust Boundaries: Clearly define trust boundaries, both external and internal.
5.	Define User Roles and Trust Levels: Define access rights 
6.	Highlight Authorization by User Role: Highlight authorization levels per user role.
7.	Define Application Entry Points: Identify interfaces where potential attackers can interact with the application or supply data.

Steps to Identify Threat Agents.

Define Possible Threats, use threat libraries for help, Map Threat Agents to Entry Points,Create visual representation of Attack Vectors and Attacks Tree,Develop a list of possible abuse cases for each application use case, Re-Define Attack Vectors

Steps to Write the threat traceability matrix - it is  a matrix that links threats to specific assets or components in the system, allowing for easy tracking and reference.

1.	Determine its potential impact (how bad an attack could be) and probability (the likelihood of the threat occurring). Can use Risk management methodologies like DREAD, PASTA.
  For DREAD use the formula 
Risk Value = (Damage + Affected users) x (Reproducibility + Exploitability + Discoverability).

 For PASTA Use the formula 
R = (TVP*I) / Countermeasures 

Rank Risks: Use a risk matrix to rank risks from most severe to least severe based on factors like means, motive, and opportunity.


Steps for Determine countermeasures and mitigation
1.	Identify Risk Owners
2.	Agree on Risk Mitigation: Collaborate with risk owners and stakeholders to review and agree upon mitigation controls for each identified risk,
3.	Build Risk Treatment Strategy: Develop a risk treatment strategy that aligns with the organization's risk management approach. Consider the following Reduce, Transfer, Avoid, Accept. 
4.	Choose the most appropriate controls to mitigate each risk. 
5.	After implementing mitigation controls, verify their effectiveness by testing 
6.	Update Risk Log
7.	Re-evaluate the threats


## a) Security hygiene 

1. Use Strong, Uniques Passwords - this is strongly advisable
2. Enable two-Factor Authentication
3. Keep Software and systems updated - this is strongly advisable
4. Secure from phishing emails
5. Do not use unknown devices such as pendrives
6. Do not download softwares from unrecognized websites

## b) A threat model for imaginary company

### Description
My threat model is created based on a cleaning company which provides services through online website. It is a very small company with 10 employees. The employees have devices to communicate with the customers. The online website is used to take service orders from customers with payments and assign tasks to each employee. Employees can view some of the information related to the job task from the website.

### Most important assets
The most important assets in the company are,
1.	Customer management system – customer personal information and service history, payments
2.	Employee management – Employee data, training records, payroll
3.	Database server - All the data stored in here.


### Security Requirements – 
1.	Implement Firewalls to protect systems align with trust boundaries.
2.	Access controls for employees to view customer data and payment details.
3.	Regular software updates
4.	Data backup and security
5.	Install and maintain Antivirus and Anti-Malware software on desktops.

### What can go wrong & What can we do
1.	Spoofing – Unauthorized access to customer or employee accounts
What can we do -Implement 2 factor authentication.
2.	Tampering – Unauthorized modification of customer Data, employee records, or website content
What can we do -Use encryption to protect customer and employee data or website content.
3.	Repudiation – Transaction issues
What can we do - Plan to revive the logs in server.
4.	Information Disclosure – Unauthorized access to customer data, employee records, or sensitive business information such as payment details.
What can we do - Apply access control to restrict data access, educate employees about data privacy, Use data encryption
5.	Deniel of Service – Online website Disruption
What can we do - Plane for service continuity during outages
6.	Elevation of privilege – Unauthorized access due to lifted privileges in online website or systems with sensitive information.
What can we do - Monitor suspicious activity, maintain strong access control than present.

All the threat values in Information Disclosure, Tampering, and Elevation of services consider as high expected.  As unauthorized access to sensitive customer and employee data can result in severe financial and reputation damage, Unauthorized modification of data specially financial or transaction data can lead to significant financial damage, Data breaches with lifted privileges can lead to extensive damage with costly recovery.

All the threat values in Deniel services, Spoofing and Identity, Repudiation consider as moderate expected. As the service disrupt which occurs due to denial of service has lower financial impact, Unauthorized access to accounts can result in financial losses but it depends on which account is effected, also Disputes over transactions can resolved by customer service employee so it is a temporally crisis. 

Threat actors
1.	Competitors to stole customer database.
2.	Hackers for financial gains from online transactions
3.	Phishers to steal login credentials and personal information.
