### one way function - section 2.3 & 2.4

One-way functions are important in public-key cryptography. These functions are easy to calculate in one direction but very hard to reverse. It's like breaking a plate into pieces, easy to do but tough to put back together. 

However, these one-way functions can't be directly used for encryption because you can't easily reverse them. Instead, they serve as building blocks for other cryptographic methods. There's also something called a trapdoor one-way function, which is like a one-way function but can be reversed if you know a secret. 

One-way hash functions are used to create fixed-length codes from variable-length data. It's like making a fingerprint for a piece of data. Hash functions are one-way, meaning it's easy to create the code from data, but hard to recreate the original data from the code. This is useful for file verification and security.

Message authentication codes (MACs), which are like hash functions but use a secret key for added security. Only someone with the key can verify the code.

### Phishing Through email

Phishing is when people send fake emails that seem to come from trustworthy sources. They do this to try and get your password. These emails might have dangerous things in them or links to fake websites that try to trick you into giving away your information.

Why do people click on phishing links?

1.	Because they’re curious.
2.	Because the message seems real.
3.	Because they think they know the sender.

How to protect yourself:

1.	Use Sender Policy Framework (SPF) to check the sender’s IP address.
2.	Always check SPF records for the targeted domain.
3.	Use DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) to add a digital signature to emails.
4.	Use Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) to receive reports and detect abuse.
5.	Use filtering to protect against malware and spam.
6.	Use URL whitelisting to allow specific domains and block others.
7.	Consider grey listing to prevent spam.
8.	Aware of site cloning, especially for stealing credentials.
9.	Watch out for IDN homograph attacks that use foreign characters.
10.	Be wary of package delivery messages and emails from service desks.


## a) Install Hashcat

First update and install the app, use below commands

$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get -y install hashid hashcat wget

Next Create a new directory

$ mkdir hashed

$ cd hashed

Next get the Rockyou Dictionary

$ wget https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz

$ tar xf rockyou.txt.tar.gz

$ rm rockyou.txt.tar.gz

Check the passwords

$ head rockyou.txt

## b) crack the hash 8eb8e307a6d649bc7fb51443a06a216f

Type below command to crack
$ hashcat -m 0 '8eb8e307a6d649bc7fb51443a06a216f' rockyou.txt -o solved

Then view the cracked password

## c) gone phising

<img width="517" alt="image" src="https://github.com/QwQw-1122/Information-Security-course/assets/142783507/379dc78f-1dd2-4e17-bb06-267f0c85dc71">

Phishing targeted group is TikTok users
The goal is to click the loggin button and submit the TikTok username and password
Here i have used Social engineeering tactic to manupulate the person to click the button.
Also the technical part here is the domain spoofing, the hacker has created a imperonate website by creating domain that looks similar to the actual loggin gateway.

If the email receiver looks carefully he can identify that the senders email address is a private gmail address and not real tiktok acoount. 
Also if the person check the loggin website URL carefully can see the difference
And the generic salutation 'Dear User' is also suspicious.
