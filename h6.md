### 7 things you should no about TOR

Some attacks compromise Tor users through browser exploits or misconfigurations, not cryptographic weaknesses. Tor serves various purposes, secure military communication, family privacy, journalism, and protection against online threats. Using Tor doesn't help criminals, it can even protect against certain criminal tactics. Tor has no military backdoor. It is an open-source software. Running a Tor relay is generally legal in the US. However exit relay operators may contacted by law enforcement. Tor is user-friendly, especially through the Tor Browser Bundle or Tails. Tor's speed has improved over time, and more relays contribute to its speed. Tor is not flawless, misusing it can give us trouble. Use the recommended tools, keep software updated.

### Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser

Introduction

Tor, a modified Firefox browser, hides users' IP addresses, making tracing them extremely difficult. It offers easy-to-use, making it accessible for anyone to browse and communicate online without identification.

History and intended use of the onion router.

Tor is designed for anonymous internet communication and offers various uses, including bypassing government prohibition, enabling to communicate anonymously, and helping for private business conversations.
Tor was initially developed by the US government but is now open for improvement by various experts worldwide.
It has both forensic analysis and investigation perspectives: one focuses on examining devices with Tor artifacts, while the other involves investigate Tor to capture communications or criminals.

How the onion router works

Tor directs internet traffic through random relays, adding layers of unbreakable encryption.
The route changes every 10 minutes, making tracking difficult.
Data sent via Tor is like an onion, with layers peeled off at each relay.
Tor hides the true IP address, making it practically impossible to trace users

Tracking criminals using TOR

The biggest weakness of the Tor browser is user customization, which can leak information. Customizations like enabling geolocation or certain plugins risk exposing the user's IP address. Attempts to control entry and exit nodes or use man-in-the-middle attacks to compromise Tor are difficult. Investigating Tor users may involve tactics, tracking codes in emails or documents, but these methods carry risks.
